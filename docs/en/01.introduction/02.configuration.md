#### Addon Configuration

#### Google API

A Google maps and geocoding API key can be provided by the field type configuration.

You can set the key by publishing the field type and setting the value:

    php artisan addon:publish anomaly.field_type.geocoder // See google.php config file.

You can also set the key by setting the `GEOCODER_KEY` value in your `.env` file.
> Google has removed the ability to use http referer limitations on the API key. If you set these you cannot use the geocode() function{.danger}
